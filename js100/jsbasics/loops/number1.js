/*
Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. 
Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?
*/

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
   console.log(i)     // include your code here  
}
// -> 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 10 will be the result
